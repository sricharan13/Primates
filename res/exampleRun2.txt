\f0\fs24 \cf0 Let's try to create a sanctuary with -ve number of cages/ troops /area\
\
Sanctuary with -ve cages\
Error: negative arguments are not accepted\
\
Sanctuary with -ve troops\
Error: negative arguments are not accepted\
\
Sanctuary with -ve area\
Error: negative arguments are not accepted\
\
Now let's create a sanctuary with the following intial configuration\
5, 0, 20 - cages, enclosures and enclosure area\
\
Let's try to add primates with Illegal arguments\
\
negative age: -10\
Error: age, size and weight cannot be negative\
\
negative size: -20\
Error: age, size and weight cannot be negative\
\
negative weight: -40\
Error: age, size and weight cannot be negative\
\
We cannot add animals with illegal arguments the arguments should be valid\
\
Adding 4 Primates to the Sanctuary, The details of the Primates are:\
Name: M1, Age: 10, Sex: M, Species: drill, Size: 20, Weight: 40, Fav Food: Sap\
Name: A2, Age: 15, Sex: F, Species: drill, Size: 10, Weight: 50, Fav Food: leaves\
Name: C3, Age: 15, Sex: F, Species: mangabey, Size: 30, Weight: 20, Fav Food: sap\
Name: C2, Age: 10, Sex: M, Species: saki, Size: 20, Weight: 15, Fav Food: insects\
\
Let's see what happens when we want add a new species - ape\
Error: incorrect food/species given\
What are the species allowed in our sanctuary?\
[MANGABEY, TAMARIN, HOWLER, GUEREZA, SQUIRREL, SAKI, SPIDER, DRILL]\
\
We'll add a new species - ape, to our allowed species\
The species allowed are:\
[MANGABEY, TAMARIN, APE, HOWLER, GUEREZA, SQUIRREL, SAKI, SPIDER, DRILL]\
\
Now we can add a new species to our sanctuary\
\
Here is a list of all primates in our sanctuary\
\{APE=[CAGE-5], DRILL=[CAGE-1, CAGE-2], MANGABEY=[CAGE-3], SAKI=[CAGE-4]\}\
\
How many animals are in our sanctuary?\
Total animals in Sacntuary:5\
\
Can we move a primate to enclosure?\
let's move primate A1 to enclosure and see what happens\
Error: no space in enclosure\
\
We can increase the number of troops\
current enclosure space: 0\
after updating the enclosure space is: 3}
